# Ocean Energy
Energy within our oceans can be found in different forms, with the most common being:

* Tidal
* Waves
* Current
* Thermal

Here in Hawai'i, the tides are considered "micro-tidal", which means their fluctations are relatively small. We also don't have a predictable current field that can serve as a sustained resource (e.g., Gulf Stream). We'll skip these two for the time being, but do know there are places around the world where these are primary candidates.

Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) does have application here in Hawai'i, atleast from a science and engineering perspective. Economic challenges still remain, in which the return on investment has limited
