# Who's Presenting?
My official title with the [Ocean Energy](https://www.hnei.hawaii.edu/research/ocean-energy/) group at the [Hawaii Natural Energy Institute](https://www.hnei.hawaii.edu/) (HNEI) is "Assistant Researcher", but that isn't very descriptive. If you arrived here by way of [my personal website](https://saltynexus.com) or have viewed [my work profile](https://www.hnei.hawaii.edu/staff/troy-heitmann/), I hope I need no introduction. 

but I like to say that I'm a "Research Engineer" with a focus on coastal processes.

## What is an Ocean Engineer?
To answer this, I'll quote my alumni, Flordia Atlantic University (FAU):

>Ocean engineers study the oceans to determine the effects of waves, currents and the salt water environment on ships and other marine vehicles and structures and develop methods and materials to withstand wave forces and protect against corrosion. Ocean engineers are also involved in development and use of manned and remotely operated sub-surface vehicles for deep-sea exploration and resource recovery.

Despite its lack in popularity, ocean engineering used to be a well defined discipline often operating under its own department. However, today you'll find that the the discipline has been absorbed by other departments. When I attended FAU as an undergraduate, the discipline was offered by the "Department of Ocean Engineering". Today, it is offered by the [Department of Ocean and Mechanical Engineering](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/ome/). Berkley is another example, where ocean engineering is offered as a discipline within the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.berkeley.edu/research-areas-and-major-fields/ocean-engineering/). However, Rhode Island still offers the discipline through the [Department of Ocean Engineering](https://web.uri.edu/oce/). Point being, the ocean engineering discipline is out there, you just have to look a little closer within some schools. Below is a list I've compiled for your convience:
