# Wave Energy: An Ocean Engineer's High-Level Perspective

July 8, 2024

This past week, Dr. Debbie Milikan invited me join a group of community experts in a meeting with 22 high school students from public and private schools around Oahu Hawai'i. These students were selected for the new [Sustainability Fellowship](https://www.punahou.edu/academics/sustainability/sustainability-fellowship) hosted by Punahou School. The networking event aimed to inspire and support the Sustainability Fellows, who have diverse interests ranging from energy technology to land management to slow fashion, but share a common goal: achieving an equitable energy transition and a livable planet. Inline with the meeting objectives, this Jupyter Book presents a high-level overview of my career path and provides a brief introduction to the ocean energy sector, with a particular focus on wave energy conversion technology.
