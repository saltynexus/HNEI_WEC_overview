# Wave Modeling
Waves have the benefit of being highly predictable. This is due advances in our ability to predict the wind, which is the predominate forcing mechanism for waves.

The material contents presented in this section were provided by [Dr. Ning Li](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/soestwp/about/directory/ning-li/) from the [Ocean and Resources Engineering (ORE) Department](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/ore/) at the [University of Hawai'i at Manoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/). As a developer of [NOAA's Integrated Ocean Observing System](https://ioos.noaa.gov/about/about-us/) (IOOS), Dr. Li is largely responsible for the research and development of the [Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System](http://www.pacioos.hawaii.edu/) (PacIOOS) wave forcast system.

```{attention}
For all you surfers out there, her multi-day [wave model forcast](http://www.pacioos.hawaii.edu/waves-category/model/) is **freely available** on the PacIOOS website. If you are wondering how well her forecast performs, she also provides objective model comparisons with [instrument oberservations](http://www.pacioos.hawaii.edu/waves-category/buoy/) (click on "Forecast").
