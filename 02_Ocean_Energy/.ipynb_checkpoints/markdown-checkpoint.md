# Ocean Energy
Energy within our oceans can be found in different forms, with the most common being:

* Tidal
* Waves
* Current
* Thermal

## Tidal and Current
Most of us here in Hawai'i have seen a wind turbine. Here on O'ahu, as you approach Kahuku, you can't miss them. Imagine sticking that technology underwater. This is basically what constitutes an ocean tidal or current energy conversion device.

The working principle shown in {numref}`airfoil` is based on an [airfoil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airfoil), only once located underwater, we'd call it a hydrofoil. In summary, the flow velocity over the top generates a pressure drop, which leads to a pressure differential that generates a lift force. As you can imagine, the shape, angle, and even fluid properties effect the resulting lift force. This area of study is a topic in fluid mechanics and has widespread application.

### Tidal

Here in Hawai'i, the tides are considered "micro-tidal", which means their fluctations in amplitude are relatively small. In fact, there are only a few places in the world where this technology really excells. {numref}`tidal_ranges` illustrates the world distribution of mean spring tidal range (MHWSâ€“MLWS).

 We also don't have a predictable current field that can serve as a sustained resource (e.g., Gulf Stream). We'll skip these two for the time being, but do know there are places around the world where these are primary candidates.

Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) does have application here in Hawai'i, atleast from a science and engineering perspective. Economic challenges still remain, in which the return on investment has limited
