# Wave Energy: An Ocean Engineer's High-Level Perspective

July 8, 2024

This past week, Dr. Debbie Milikan asked me to meet with a group of 22 high school students from public and private schools around Oahu Hawai'i. The students were selected as part of new [Sustainability Fellowship](https://www.punahou.edu/academics/sustainability/sustainability-fellowship) hosted by Punahou School. I didn't have a formal presentation on hand, so I decided to take this opportunity to create a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org).

Given the short turn around, this version of the document will mostly contain picture which I'll use to facilitate my discussion at the student career fair. I owe a special thanks to my colleagues: Dr. Ning Li, Dr. Zhenhua Huang, Mayah Walker, and Clink C. M. Reyes, for providing me with content to present on. In collaboration with my colleagues, I hope to expand on this document, pumping more life into it and fully explore the potential of Jupyter Books as a means to disseminate information.

Below I've provided a high-level overview of the document chapters. These are also presented in the menubar on the left of the screen, which you can minimize using the hamburber menu button located at the top left of the screen. Each chapter can have multiple content headings, which are presented on the right of the screen. You can use these menus to help navigate the content or step through using the back/advance arrows at the bottom of the screen.
