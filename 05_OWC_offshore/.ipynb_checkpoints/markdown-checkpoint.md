The material contents presented in this section were provided by Nic Ulm from the [Ocean and Resources Engineering (ORE) Department](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/ore/) in collaboration with [Dr. Krishnakumar Rajagopalan](https://www.hnei.hawaii.edu/staff/krishnakumar-rajagopalan/), Kyle Pappas, and Duncan Lajousky from the [Hawaii Natural Energy Institute (HNEI)](https://www.hnei.hawaii.edu/) at the [University of Hawai'i at Manoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/).  

An [oscillating water column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillating_water_column) (OWC) represents a class of wave energy converters. The working principle is based on fluid-fluid interaction, in which one fluid body forces another through a small orifice, creating a high **velocity** jet.
